# Release preflight and recovery

## Command

```bash
npm run release:preflight
```

You can also trigger the **Release Preflight** workflow through GitHub Actions. A `v*` tag and the npm publish workflow must pass the same gate. Preflight never creates a tag, publishes a package, or deploys documentation.

## What will it do

1. Reject a candidate with uncommitted files, an invalid installed dependency tree, or a current commit that has not been pushed to `origin`.
2. Check whether `package-lock.json` is consistent with the current `package.json` version and does not contain `file:` / `workspace:` / sibling local path residue.
3. Check whether the changelog for the current version and packaged `MIGRATION.md` / `SECURITY.md` files exist.
4. Check whether the necessary documents for project management exist:
   - `docs/en/support-matrix.md`
   - `docs/en/file-dependency-governance.md`
   - `docs/en/verification-entrypoints.md`
   - `docs/zh/support-matrix.md`
   - `docs/zh/file-dependency-governance.md`
   - `docs/zh/verification-entrypoints.md`
5. Run the fast static/runtime gate and the complete public verification chain.
6. Require source coverage, runnable examples, the MongoDB server matrix, real dataTasks integration, the CLI matrix, and package-install smoke tests.
7. Use a clean install to verify docs-site types, build output, internal links, and dependency audit.
8. Run `npm pack --dry-run` and verify the packaged file boundary.
9. Keep `prepublishOnly` and repository publishing on the same `release:preflight` source so a direct publish cannot bypass the gate.
10. Keep `verify:release` as an explicit supplementary private-environment check; it is not a substitute for the public gate. Record a `skipReason` when that private environment is not configured instead of reporting a pass.

## Why not publish directly?

The goal of this script is to close the version information, public verification chain, dependency release boundary, and package consumability first, and then enter the release/tag/publish stage of manual confirmation.

## Recommended order

```bash
git status
git commit
git push origin HEAD
# Wait for remote CI on this commit, then run on the same clean commit:
npm run release:preflight
# Run the manual Release Authentication Check workflow and require npm whoami to pass.
# Optional private real-environment review: npm run verify:release
VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
git tag "v${VERSION}"
git push origin "v${VERSION}"
```

`release:preflight` verifies that the current `HEAD` exists on `origin`, so it cannot run against an uncommitted or local-only candidate. Before creating the tag, manually confirm remote CI, preflight evidence, and a successful **Release Authentication Check** run for the current repository. The authentication probe only runs `npm whoami`; it does not create a tag or publish. Preflight itself never creates or pushes a tag.

The tag starts the repository preflight and publish workflows. Do not deploy Pages yet. After registry acceptance succeeds, manually run **Deploy Docs to GitHub Pages** with `release_tag=vX.Y.Z`; that workflow checks out the tag and refuses deployment unless tag, `package.json`, and npm registry versions match.

If a tag-triggered publish fails for a recoverable reason such as authentication or registry availability, the publish workflow can be started manually with that exact existing `release_tag`. The workflow checks out and verifies the tag commit; it cannot publish the default branch as an untagged release.

## Post-publish acceptance

Run these checks against the exact version before creating or finalizing the GitHub Release:

```bash
VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
npm view "monsqlize@${VERSION}" version dist.integrity dist.tarball --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
npm view monsqlize dist-tags --json --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
npm --prefix "${TEMP_DIR}" init -y
npm --prefix "${TEMP_DIR}" install "monsqlize@${VERSION}" --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
node -e "const M=require('${TEMP_DIR}/node_modules/monsqlize'); if (!M) process.exit(1)"
node --input-type=module -e "import M from '${TEMP_DIR}/node_modules/monsqlize/dist/esm/index.mjs'; if (!M) process.exit(1)"
"${TEMP_DIR}/node_modules/.bin/monsqlize" --version
```

Acceptance requires the requested version, integrity and tarball metadata to exist; `latest` to point to the intended stable version; CJS, ESM and CLI loading to pass; the Git tag to resolve to the release commit; and the GitHub Release plus Pages deployment to reference that same tag.

## Half-release recovery

Capture `VERSION`, the previous stable version, release commit, and registry evidence before changing anything:

```bash
VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
PREVIOUS_STABLE=2.0.6
RELEASE_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
npm view "monsqlize@${VERSION}" version dist.integrity --json --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/ || true
npm view monsqlize dist-tags --json --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
git ls-remote --tags origin "refs/tags/v${VERSION}"
```

- **Tag exists, npm version is absent:** keep the immutable tag on the reviewed release commit, fix authentication or workflow failure, rerun preflight, and rerun publish for the same tag. Do not deploy docs.
- **npm version exists, tag or GitHub Release is missing:** verify registry integrity first, then create/push `v${VERSION}` at `RELEASE_COMMIT` and create the GitHub Release from that exact tag. Never move a tag that consumers may already have fetched.
- **A defective package became `latest`:** restore the previous stable dist-tag, keep the defective version available for audit, mark it deprecated, publish a new corrective version, and only then move `latest` forward.

```bash
npm dist-tag add "monsqlize@${PREVIOUS_STABLE}" latest
npm dist-tag add "monsqlize@${VERSION}" next
npm deprecate "monsqlize@${VERSION}" "Superseded; use ${PREVIOUS_STABLE} until the corrective release is available"
```

- **Docs do not match npm:** run the Pages workflow with the last npm-verified stable tag. The workflow will reject unpublished or mismatched versions.
- **Registry integrity differs from the reviewed package:** stop. npm versions are immutable; do not retag or republish over the version. Preserve the evidence and issue a new version after investigation.
