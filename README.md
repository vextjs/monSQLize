# monSQLize
monSQLize is a universal query adapter that converts various query languages (e.g., SQL for MySQL, PostgreSQL) into MongoDB syntax. It dynamically translates familiar query styles into MongoDB-compatible operations, reducing complexity, saving effort, and improving efficiency, so developers can focus on application logic.
